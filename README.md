## Introduction

The **MovieWeb App** is a Flask-based web application designed to help users manage their favorite movies. It integrates with the OMDb API to fetch detailed movie information and provides robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for both users and movies. The app uses SQLite as its database backend and leverages SQLAlchemy for ORM-based interactions.

---

## Features

- **User Management**:
  - Add new users.
  - View a list of all registered users.
  - Delete users.
  
- **Movie Management**:
  - Add movies to a user's favorites using the OMDb API.
  - View a user's favorite movies.
  - Update movie details manually or via API-provided data.
  - Delete movies from a user's favorites.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Graceful handling of HTTP errors (404, 500).
  - Informative error messages for invalid inputs, API failures, or database issues.

- **Data Persistence**:
  - Uses SQLite for storing user and movie data.
  - Supports many-to-many relationships between users and movies.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the MovieWeb App, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.10+ ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- Flask (`pip install flask`)
- Flask-SQLAlchemy (`pip install flask_sqlalchemy`)
- Requests (`pip install requests`)
- python-dotenv (`pip install python-dotenv`)

Additionally, you'll need an API key from OMDb to fetch movie details:
- Sign up for an API key at [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/moviweb-app.git
   cd moviweb-app
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   If a `requirements.txt` file exists:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Otherwise, install the required packages manually:
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy requests python-dotenv
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OMDb API key:
     ```
     OMDB_API_KEY=your_omdb_api_key_here
     ```

5. **Initialize the Database**:
   - Run the app to create the SQLite database:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - Optionally, seed the database with sample data:
     ```bash
     python seed.py
     ```

6. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The app will run on `http://localhost:5001`.

## Usage

1. **Home Page**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5001/` to see the home page.

2. **Users List**:
   - Access `/users` to view all registered users.
   - Click on a user to see their favorite movies.

3. **Add User**:
   - Go to `/add_user` to add a new user.
   - Provide a unique ID and name.

4. **Add Movie**:
   - Navigate to `/users/<user_id>/add_movie` to add a movie to a user's favorites.
   - Enter the movie title to fetch details from OMDb.
   - Optionally override fetched details (e.g., year, rating).

5. **Update Movie**:
   - Visit `/users/<user_id>/update_movie/<movie_id>` to edit a movie's details.
   - Modify fields like name, director, year, or rating.

6. **Delete Movie**:
   - Use `/users/<user_id>/delete_movie/<movie_id>` to remove a movie from a user's favorites.

7. **Delete User**:
   - Access `/delete_user/<user_id>` to delete a user and their associated movies.

## Error Handling

The app implements robust error handling mechanisms:

- **HTTP Errors**:
  - Handles common HTTP errors like `404 Not Found` and `500 Internal Server Error`.
  - Displays custom error pages (`404.html`, `500.html`) for improved user experience.

- **Python Exceptions**:
  - Catches exceptions during database operations, API calls, and form submissions.
  - Provides informative flash messages to guide users.
